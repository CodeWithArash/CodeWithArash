## Hi there, I'm ArashðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a data analyst with a background in engineering and a deep passion for turning raw data into meaningful, actionable insights.
I work with Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), SQL, and Tableau to explore data, find hidden patterns, and support smarter decision-making. Whether itâ€™s cleaning messy datasets, building clear visual dashboards, or writing complex queries, I enjoy making data come to life.
I believe in the power of data to drive growth, reduce uncertainty, and tell impactful stories. Iâ€™m constantly learning, improving my BI and data modeling skills, and keeping up with the fast-evolving data world.

Iâ€™m currently exploring new opportunities where I can apply my data skills to solve real-world problems and help businesses grow.

Letâ€™s connect!
